### Hi there, it's me!

I believe in developing software according to the needs of the user.
My interests lie in human computer interaction (HCI) and software development engineering (SDE).

In my free time, you can catch me reading novels, playing cricket, uploading videos on Youtube or taking part in competive programming contests.
